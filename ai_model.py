Offers dedicated GPUs and powerful\n CPUs, though not as powerful as the workstation class. - ~$1800+3. (Mac - If your software is compatible):Laptop:\n MacBook Pro 16\" (M1 Pro/Max or M2 Pro/Max) - Excellent performance, \nespecially if your research software is optimized for macOS. - ~$2500+Key Considerations for an Astrophysics Researcher:CPU:\n Intel Core i7 or i9 H-series or AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 H-series (or Apple \nSilicon M1 Pro/Max/M2 Pro/Max).  The higher the core count and clock \nspeed, the better.RAM: 32GB or 64GB. Astrophysics simulations and data analysis can be memory-intensive.Storage: 1TB or 2TB NVMe SSD.  Fast storage for large datasets and quick access to applications.GPU:\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or higher (or AMD Radeon RX 6700M or higher, or\n Apple Silicon). The GPU will be important for simulations and data \nvisualization. Consider a workstation-class GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX A \nseries) if your software specifically benefits from it.Display: A high-resolution display (1440p or 4K) can be helpful for visualizing data and working on articles.Software Compatibility:Check\n if the software you use for your research (simulation software, data \nanalysis tools) is compatible with your chosen operating system \n(Windows, macOS, or Linux).",
